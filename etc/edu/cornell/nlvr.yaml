  Cornell Natural Language Visual Reasoning (NLVR) is a language grounding dataset.
  It contains 92,244 pairs of natural language statements grounded in synthetic images. 
  The task is to determine whether a sentence is true or false about an image. 
  The data was collected through crowdsourcing, and requires reasoning about sets of objects, 
  quantities, comparisons, and spatial relations.
